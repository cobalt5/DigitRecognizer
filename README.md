Hi! I'm Nathan, this is a documentation of my introduction to neural networks. I used the MNIST Digits Database.

I haven't yet implemented a program where you run a previously trained model, so all files that use the model are also training it beforehand.

You can see the results of testing different models in results.txt.

The programs training and testing models are named as such:
<model structure>.py

So for example a 4 layer neural network (with 1 layer as input and 1 layer as output) with 2 layers inbetween made up from 16 nodes each, would be named:
16_times_2.py

If the program includes evaluation/validation functionality, it would have a "v_" preceeding the name, for example:
v_16_times_2.py

Anyone is free to copy my code from this repository and do whatever they wish with it(as long as its legal).
